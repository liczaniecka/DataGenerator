# DataGenerator

This script generates a set of data on the university admissions process. 
The data is saved in csv files. 
There are two generators, as main.py generates data for a relational database, while make_excel.py generates data for the second data source - an Excel file.
In the future, I hope to develop this script, so it generates student's city of origin from a list of real polish cities and a voivodeship, that matches it.
